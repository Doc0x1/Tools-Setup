# Tools-Setup
Sets up my favorite pentesting tools.
## Installation
The installation requires you to have a Debian based distribution, like Kali Linux or Parrot OS. 
- This script WILL NOT work on Arch or anything that doesn't use the apt package manager.
### Install Methods
  #### One method you can use is to clone this repo, and then run the install script.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Doc0x1/Tools-Setup.git && cd ./Tools-Setup && bash ./install-tools.sh
```
  ##### (I think it works? Could use some testers, if it doesn't work just lemme know thanks <3)

  #### Another method is to simply use this one liner:
```
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Doc0x1/Tools-Setup/master/install-tools.sh | bash -s -
```

## Happy Pentesting!
Now quit playing video games and go learn how to use some of these tools.
