# Tools-Setup
Sets up my favorite pentesting tools.
## Installation
The installation requires you to have a Debian based distribution, like Kali Linux or Parrot OS. 
- This script WILL NOT work on Arch or anything that doesn't use the apt package manager.
### Install Methods
- One method you can use is to clone this repo, and then run the install script.
  - `git clone https://github.com/Doc0x1/Tools-Setup/tree/master && cd ./Tools-Setup && bash ./install-tools.sh`
- Another method is to simply use this one liner (I think it works? Could use some testers, if it doesn't work just lemme know thanks <3):
  - `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Doc0x1/Tools-Setup/master/install-tools.sh` | bash -s -`
### For anyone having issues
If you have issues with any of the install methods or the script itself, feel free to open up an issue on this repo or find me here:

## Happy Pentesting!
Now quit playing video games and go learn how to use some of these tools.
